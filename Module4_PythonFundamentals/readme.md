🏆 Capstone Project – Survey Feedback Analyzer

Objectives:
-Analyze textual survey feedback using Python fundamentals
-Clean and preprocess text data using string and list operations
-Apply loops and conditional statements for classification and summarisation
-Automate insights extraction using custom user-defined functions

Project Overview:
-This project demonstrates how Python can efficiently analyse survey feedback data.
-It begins with a predefined dataset of customer feedback stored in a dictionary of lists, then allows users to add new feedback entries dynamically.
-The program performs text cleaning, word occurrence analysis (e.g., “good”, “poor”, “excellent”), and generates insights such as the average rating, longest feedback, and a list of unique words used.
